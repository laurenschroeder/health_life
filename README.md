National health spending across the world and life expectancy.

An interactive scatter plot created to show the change in life expectancy and money spent on health over time around the world. The plot interates between 1995 and 2014, showing the PPP expenses per capita in each country and the average life expectancy. The animation shows the general trend of increasing life expectancy and spending on healthcare, with the most significant increases in life expectancy happening in Africa over this time period.
