## Summary-
An interactive scatter plot created to show the change in life expectancy and money spent on health over time around the world. The plot interates between 1995 and 2014, showing the PPP expenses per capita in each country and the average life expectancy. The animation shows the general trend of increasing life expectancy and spending on healthcare, with the most significant increases in life expectancy happening in Africa over this time period. Users can hover over data points to see country names and view any specific year using the buttons on the left.

## Design-
I chose to use a scatterplot to show the relationship between health spending and life expectancy. In countries that had higher spending in life expectancy in 1995, spending generally increased at a high rate but life expectancy was more capped. For this reason, I used a logarithmic spending axis to highlight these changes, while showing the significant increase in life expectancy in African countries.

Countries are tagged by continent using a color key. This makes it much easier to observe general trends during the animation. I added year filters at the end of the animation to allow users to investigate specific events during this time span.
